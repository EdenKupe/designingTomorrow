    <h2>What is Designing Tomorrow(s)?</h2>
    <p>Designing Tomorrow(s) is a set of tools, methodologies and ideas to do just that: re-design, re-imagine, and re-think our future.</p>
</section>
<section class="contentSlice">
    <h2>At Designing Tomorrow(s), we believe that the future is <span class="pulse">weird</span>.</h2>
    <p>This is because the future doesnâ€™t exist yet; those that talk of the future as a thing we hurtle towards misunderstand it. However, the future is also something that will exist one day and has its roots in the present. The future is a <span class="pulse">weird</span> loop.</p>
</section>
<section class="contentSlice">
    <h2>Why design tomorrow?</h2>
    <p>What if we used this <span class="pulse">weirdness</span> to our advantage? What if, by forcing our imaginations to work with the <span class="pulse">weird</span>, to articulate the <span class="pulse">weird</span>, we could hack, break, and change the stories we tell ourselves about the future? Make these stories more inclusive, more decolonial, more radical?</p>

    <h2>What is this site for?</h2>
    <p>This site is meant as a <span class="pulse">handbook</span> to help you think about, and design, tomorrow. Read the <span class="pulse">intros</span> below to find out more about why and how we created it. Or jump into one of the <span class="pulse">devices and methodologies</span> for ideas on how to run your own workshop!</p>
