title: "Speculative Tourism"
---

Speculative Tourism is an international project that operates at the crossroads of
science fiction, historical tourism, Augmented Reality and local action project
developed by Mushon Zer-Aviv and Shalev Moran. The project is an invitation to
imagining possible. The idea is to enable the creation of new narratives, unleash
socio-political imagination and enable participants to reimaging familiar or historical
places. Speculative Tourism can be used as an artistic or creative touristic tool as
much as a creative element in policy making. Mushon’s and Shalev’s goal is:
“freeing the political imagination, while shedding light on local identities
and reacquainting ourselves with our lived environments; we use fiction
and speculation to reveal different ways of taking responsibility for our
habitats and our future.” https://www.speculativetourism.com/
Speculative Tourism is also their response, as digital designers, to current trends in
Augmented Reality technologies. The tours are created collaboratively in workshop
formats. One part of the methodology used to design the speculative tours is based
on Peter Frase 2016 book ”Four Futures”. Peter Frase developed his four futures
method in order to design extreme but possible scenarios for a society after what he
thinks will be the inescapable collapse of capitalism as we know it today. Zer-Aviv
and Moran adapted this method where two axes are built based on “grand shifts in
global conditions” In Frasers case, these axes described shifts towards either a more
equal or hierarchical society, and towards more scarcity or more abundant material
conditions. In the case of speculative tourism, this model is extracted without the
contents.
To begin the exercise, questions about the future are designed matching the aim of
the tour which is to be created. This usually begins with a collection of broad
questions about the future. When enough are collected, those are identified that have
two distinct qualities:
1. We are truly uncertain of what the future holds for this issue.
2. We can roughly place the possible answers on an axis between two extremes.
Those “Axes of Uncertainty” as Zer-Aviv and Moran call them, are then crossed to
form a matrix.
Most workshops have a number of participants that requires people working and
writing together. The participants are asked to draw up an axis of uncertainty and
then go around to the other participants to share their axis and to try and find a
juxtaposition that seems interesting and perhaps surprising. This step helps to
identify writing partners who might think of very different questions to one’s own,
which in turn can lead to a more fruitful dialog and more robust speculations.The
workshop participants go on to imagine how a future society might work under the
parameters of each of the four quadrants, starting in broad strokes and big ideas
about that future.
“The beautiful thing about the Four Futures method, is that there will
always be a quadrant or two that surprises us, that our judgement does
not automatically categorize as utopian or dystopian.”

This quadrant is then chosen as the one that is fleshed out in the further course of
the workshop using additional methods such as back casting and other creative
thinking exercises including story telling methods, world building and other
methodologies drawn from the design and teaching work of both creators of this
project. The results of the workshops are audio tours, maps and other outputs that
offer touristic guidance through the futures created. Since 2017 Shalev and Mushon
have created five collections of speculative tourism tours, the latest in Pristina in
2022. The tours can be downloaded via their website
